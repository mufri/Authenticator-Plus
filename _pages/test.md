Clash of Old and New
--------------------

Today was my day to facilitate for a graduate student discussion
seminar. The seminar is well attended by quite a handful of faculty and
post-docs, some thirty people. The discussion is almost always dominated
by a few faculty, which is a great source of information but offers
little opportunity for students to ask questions or wrestle with ideas
themselves. To get at this, I tried breaking the class into small groups
for the first half and passing out different sets of discussion
questions. Things didn't go as planned...
