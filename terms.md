    Version 1.0 [DRAFT 01]
    
    Effective on Dec 5, 2013
    
    
    Terms
    By accessing this web site and/or the Authenticator Plus and Authenticator Plus Pro mobile application(s), you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this web site are protected by applicable copyright and trade mark law.
    
    
    Use License
    
    Purchases of Mufri mobile applications on the Android platform (either through an initial payment, in-app purchases or other means) may be refundable for a short time period in accordance with the refund policy of the application store from which the purchase was made. Once this time period elapses, all purchases are 100% non-refundable. Mufri is in no way responsible for handling these refunds.
    
    Permission is granted to use the Authenticator Plus mobile application(s). This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
    
        modify or copy the materials;
        use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
        attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Mufri's web site(s), or mobile application(s);
        remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
        transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server or in another application.
    
    This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Mufri at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.
    
    
    Disclaimer
    The Authenticator Plus application(s) are provided "as is". Mufri makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Mufri does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials int Its applications(s) or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this application.
    
    
    Limitations
    In no event shall Mufri or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Mufri's application(s), even if Mufri or a Mufri authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
    
    
    Revisions and Errata
    The materials appearing on Mufri's web site(s) and application(s) could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Mufri does not warrant that any of the materials on its web site are accurate, complete, or current. Mufri may make changes to the materials contained on its web site at any time without notice. Mufri does not, however, make any commitment to update the materials.
    
    
    Links
    Mufri has not reviewed all of the sites linked to via its mobile application(s) and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Mufri of the site. Use of any such linked web site is at the user's own risk.
